# CipherSpider

Black Hat Go Project

I plan to create Go functions to encrypt and decrypt messages using popular substitution ciphers, such as Caesar, Atbash, and ROT13. I also plan to create a function that does generic substitution ciphers. If I have time, I will try to create functions for keyed ciphers too, such as Vigenere. An example of the tool I'm trying to create can be found here: https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher.
